title: A Week of Upsets, New Faces on the Leaderboard
---


### Super Bowl Voodoo and A String of Upsets

It's been a week for fans of underdog schools to feel great headlined by Cal upsetting the No.1 team in the country. Other notable upsets preceded and followed Cal's upset; Kansas lost to Texas, MSU to Georgetown, Michigan to IU, Wisconsin to OSU, Pitt to Virginia, OK State to Baylor, UMass to St. Josephs and Memphis to SMU. Probably we can attribute all the upsets to Super Bowl! This year, 4 Top 10 teams lost the day before the Superbowl and you know what, the exact same thing happened last year!

Probably FanLiners were aware of this stat since most of you did a great job in correctly calling the upsets! In fact, 65% of Fanliners who predicted the Cal vs. Arizona game called it right! Maybe Vegas should look at the collective prediction made by FanLiners before setting the lines for games!

### Leaderboard Status 

As of Sunday, *Purdue* is leading in two leaderboards and *Auburn* in the other. The hardest leaderboard is the Most Accurate Fans leaderboard and even though Fanliner *Venki* still retains the No.1 spot, Fanliners *kdex* and *BearTerritory* have done very well by scoring above 50 with their first submission – looks like they are ready to challenge the players above them this week.  We are sure other new Fanliners are just warming up as well.  Looking forward to more excitement this week.
