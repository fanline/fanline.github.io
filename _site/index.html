				<h3>SMU&#39;s Climb</h3>

<p>This was a week of many firsts, in college basketball as well as for us at FanLine. This week, Southern Methodist (SMU) climbed in the Top 25 for the first time in 3 decades. If you are wondering why this is newsworthy, SMU is coached by a person who is in the Basketball Hall of Fame and is the only head coach in history to win both a NCAA and NBA Championship. He is also the only coach in history to have taken 8 different NBA teams to playoffs! </p>

Other notable upsets preceded and followed Cal&#39;s upset; Kansas lost to Texas, MSU to Georgetown, Michigan to IU, Wisconsin to OSU, Pitt to Virginia, OK State to Baylor, UMass to St. Josephs and Memphis to SMU. Probably we can attribute all the upsets to Super Bowl! This year, 4 Top 10 teams lost the day before the Superbowl and you know what, the exact same thing happened last year! Probably...
